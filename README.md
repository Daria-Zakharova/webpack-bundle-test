- When writing img src it's necessary to use 
```src="<%= require('./assets/img/cat.jpg') %>"```
syntax.

- To use ibg just add a div wrap to an img it will be automatically transformed into background image of the wrap.
Keep in mind to set sizing for the wrap.

- to run use
```npm run dev```
or 
```npm run prod```
to run on local server use
```npm run server```
